# Adaptive Exam System - Complete Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines all the fixes and improvements made to ensure the Adaptive Exam system works properly from start to finish.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Configuration Export Issue
**Problem:** Frontend couldn't import `API_BASE_URL` from config file
**Solution:** Changed export to named export at declaration
```javascript
export const API_BASE_URL = 'https://learningsphere-1fgj.onrender.com';
```

### 2. Missing Active Session Management
**Problem:** Users couldn't see or manage active exam sessions
**Solution:** Added complete active session management system

#### Backend Changes:
- Added `getActiveSession` endpoint to check for active sessions
- Added `resumeActiveSession` endpoint to resume interrupted exams
- Enhanced error handling for session conflicts

#### Frontend Changes:
- Added active session detection on StartExam page
- Created visual warning when active session exists
- Added "Resume" and "Abandon" options for active sessions
- Shows session details (questions answered, accuracy, ability level)

### 3. Response Tracking Enhancement
**Problem:** Response history didn't track ability changes properly
**Solution:** Added `abilityBefore` field to responses schema
```javascript
responses: [{
  // ... other fields
  abilityBefore: Number,
  abilityAfter: Number,
  // ...
}]
```

### 4. Analytics Data Format Issues
**Problem:** Frontend expected different field names and structures
**Solution:** Standardized analytics response format
- Changed `totalTimeSeconds` → `totalTimeSpent`
- Added `timeStats` object with fastest/average/slowest
- Added full `earnedBadges` objects (not just IDs)

### 5. Quiz Completion Flow
**Problem:** Incomplete handling of quiz completion
**Solution:** Enhanced completion response with all necessary data
- XP calculation
- Badge awarding
- Progress update
- Complete results summary

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module does not provide export named 'API_BASE_URL'"
**Solution:** Clear browser cache and restart dev server
```bash
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules/.vite
npm run dev
```

### Issue: WebSocket connection errors
**Solution:** These are Vite HMR warnings and don't affect functionality. Can be ignored.

### Issue: "You already have an active exam session"
**Solution:** The system now shows the active session with options to resume or abandon it.

### Issue: External API not responding
**Solution:** Check if `https://adaptive-exam-model.onrender.com` is accessible. It may be in sleep mode (Render free tier).
