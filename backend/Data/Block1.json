    "Data / Paragraph": "The charges of a taxi journey are decided on the basis of the distance covered and the amount of the waiting time during a journey. Distance wise, for the first 2 kilometres (or any part thereof) of a journey, the metre reading is fixed at ` 10 (if there is no waiting). Also, if a taxi is boarded and it does not move, then the metre reading is again fixed at ` 10 for the first ten minutes of waiting. For every additional kilometre the metre reading changes by ` 5 (with changes in the metre reading being in multiples of ` 1 for every 200 metres travelled). For every additional minute of waiting, the metre reading changes by ` 1. (no account is taken of a fraction of a minute waited for or of a distance less than 200 metres travelled). The net metre reading is a function of the amount of time waited for and the distance travelled. The cost of running a taxi depends on the fuel efficiency (in terms of mileage/litre), depreciation (straight line over 10 years) and the driver’s salary (not taken into account if the taxi is self owned). Depreciation is ` 100 per day everyday of the first 10 years. This depreciation has to be added equally to the cost for every customer while calculating the profit for a particular trip. Similarly, the driver’s daily salary is also apportioned equally across the customers of the particular day. Assume, for simplicity, that there are 50 customers every day (unless otherwise mentioned). The cost of fuel is ` 15 per litre (unless otherwise stated).

Also, if a taxi is boarded and it does not move, then the metre reading is again fixed at ` 10 for the first ten minutes of waiting.

The cost of running a taxi depends on the fuel efficiency (in terms of mileage/litre), depreciation (straight line over 10 years) and the driver’s salary (not taken into account if the taxi is self owned). Depreciation is ` 100 per day everyday of the first 10 years. This depreciation has to be added equally to the cost for every customer while calculating the profit for a particular trip. Similarly, the driver’s daily salary is also apportioned equally across the customers of the particular day.
